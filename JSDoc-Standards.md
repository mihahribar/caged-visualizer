# JSDoc Documentation Standards for CAGED Visualizer

## Overview
This document establishes comprehensive JSDoc documentation standards for the CAGED Visualizer project to improve code maintainability and developer experience.

## Documentation Requirements

### 1. Custom Hooks Documentation
All custom hooks must include:
- Purpose and functionality description
- Parameter descriptions with types and constraints
- Return value documentation with object properties
- Usage examples with realistic scenarios
- Performance notes for expensive operations
- Music theory context where applicable

#### Template for Custom Hooks:
```typescript
/**
 * Brief description of hook functionality
 *
 * Detailed explanation of what the hook does, including any complex
 * logic or music theory concepts it implements.
 *
 * @param paramName - Description of parameter with constraints
 * @param anotherParam - Another parameter description
 *
 * @returns Object containing:
 *   - property1: Description of what this property contains
 *   - property2: Description of what this property does
 *   - method1: Function description and usage
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const { property1, method1 } = useCustomHook('param1', 'param2');
 * const result = method1(someValue);
 * ```
 *
 * @performance Notes about expensive calculations or memoization
 * @musicTheory Explanation of relevant music theory concepts
 */
```

### 2. Component Documentation
All components must include:
- Component purpose and functionality
- Props interface documentation
- Accessibility requirements
- Usage examples
- Styling expectations

#### Template for Components:
```typescript
/**
 * Component description and purpose
 *
 * @param props - Component props
 * @param props.propName - Description of prop with type info
 * @param props.onEvent - Event handler description
 *
 * @returns JSX element representing the component
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <ComponentName
 *   propName="value"
 *   onEvent={handleEvent}
 * />
 * ```
 *
 * @accessibility Requirements and considerations
 * @styling TailwindCSS classes and responsive behavior
 */
```

### 3. Complex Function Documentation
Functions with complex logic must include:
- Algorithm explanation
- Input/output specifications
- Edge cases and error handling
- Performance characteristics

### 4. Constant and Type Documentation
- Explain purpose and usage of constants
- Document type relationships and constraints
- Include music theory explanations for CAGED-related types

## Music Theory Documentation Guidelines

### CAGED System Documentation
When documenting CAGED-related code:
- Explain chord shape relationships
- Document fret position calculations
- Clarify major vs minor chord differences
- Include interval relationships (Root, Third, Fifth)

### Example Music Theory Documentation:
```typescript
/**
 * Calculates fret positions for CAGED chord shapes
 *
 * The CAGED system uses 5 moveable chord shapes (C, A, G, E, D) that can be
 * positioned anywhere on the neck. Each shape has a specific pattern of
 * finger positions relative to the root note.
 *
 * @param shape - CAGED shape letter (C, A, G, E, or D)
 * @param rootFret - Fret position of the root note (0-15)
 * @param chordQuality - Major or minor chord quality
 *
 * @musicTheory
 * - Major chords use intervals: Root(0), Major Third(4), Perfect Fifth(7)
 * - Minor chords use intervals: Root(0), Minor Third(3), Perfect Fifth(7)
 * - Shape patterns are transposed based on root fret position
 */
```

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Custom hooks in `/src/hooks/`
2. **Medium Priority**: Main components in `/src/components/`
3. **Low Priority**: Utility functions and constants

## Quality Standards

- All public functions and components must have JSDoc comments
- Examples must be functional and realistic
- Performance notes required for expensive operations
- Music theory explanations for domain-specific logic
- Consistent formatting and terminology

## Validation

Documentation completeness will be verified by:
- Manual review of all hook files
- Example code testing
- Music theory accuracy validation
- Accessibility requirement completeness
